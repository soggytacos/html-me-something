        <main>
            <p> I received my Bachelor’s degree in Economics from Truman State University in 2015. While in school, I worked for Monsanto’s Seed Technology Program as a Compliance Coordinator assessing farms
                for compliance of the EPA’s seed technology guidelines. After graduating, I spent a year and a half working
                odd jobs like a contractor at the Tesla Motors dealership St. Louis, waiting tables at night, and working as a handyman. 
                In November 2016, ACI snatched me up to become the Dispatch Software Specialist in St. Louis. Currently, my main role in the company is
                to oversee the implementation of our new scanning system, Next Stop Mobile.</p>

            <p>The most important thing I learned from my previous profession is the importance of being adaptive in the face
                of change. A hundred years ago, an industrious farmer was one that learned how to employ his livestock and
                multi-animal equipment effectively in daily farm operations. Today, GPS-automated tractors, advanced chemical
                formulation, and genetically modified seeds have made farming vastly more efficient. The result is that the
                average farm today is 400 acres larger, produces nearly ten times as much per acre, requires 50% less water
                per bushel, and requires nearly 90% fewer man hours per bushel. In the year 1900, 40% of Americans were employed
                by agriculture. </p>
            <p class="last">Today, the number is <em>less than 2%!</em> The intent of this brief history lesson is to get readers
                thinking about why this paragraph matters in the context of ACI as a player in the logistics industry. The
                future is never certain, and the present is always changing. We must understand that the path to success
                requires us to think strategically, to fear nothing, and to be adaptable in the face of change.</p>

            <p id="abbey">Here's a picture of my german shepherd, Abbey. I was travelling throught the cornfields of South Dakota when
                she emerged out of the green stalks on the side of the gravel road. I stopped the car and rolled down the window 
                and she placed her paws on the windows and asked me to be her soul mate.
